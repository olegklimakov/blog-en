Hi 👋🏼, I am Oleg Klimakov.

I was studying to be a nuclear physicist when I realized that it was not mine. Then I changed my specialty and received a diploma as an IT engineer

I have commercial experience as Frontend Developer (Senior, Lead) with Angular, but also I am interested in backend and mobile development.

I have worked in both small startups and giant IT corporations.

Either I was a teacher of frontend for group of students.
